Hello there, my name is Ted Kesgar. I graduated from ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology) with a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering.

Currently I work at [@bukalapak][bukalapak] and live in Jakarta. I also found [@charaverse][charaverse] and write a number of open source projects, as well as contributing to other projects (usually just 1 or 2 lines). Other than that I play video games (first-person shooters and gacha games) and watch anime, vtubers, and football.

I am happy to help fellow developers if I can. Feel free to say hi on [Twitter][tkesgar-twitter].
